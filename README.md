# Sydney's Space Racer

One day my daughter told me she had an idea for a game and drew a simple picture. That was the inspiration behind this game. You can see the drawing by clicking the About Game button on the game's home screen.

## Running the game on MacOS

1. In terminal, navigate to the sydneys-space-racer folder and run a webserver:

        python -m SimpleHTTPServer

2. Open your browser at http://localhost:8000

This game was built using PhaserJS (v2.5.0). See more at https://phaser.io/
